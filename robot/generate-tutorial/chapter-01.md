Rust (pronounced as "Russian") was developed by Mozilla Foundation and aims to provide memory safety without sacrificing performance with a focus on concurrency while being safe from thread-safety errors like data races or deadlocks due to lack of synchronization primitives in the language. Rust is designed around two primary principles: simplicity (aside from its absence of garbage collection) and speed, which makes it an excellent choice for system programming where performance matters a lot but also requires low memory usage because there's no need for extra overhead like C++ does with malloc/free or new/delete.
