Sure, here's how you can write a very basic "Hello World!" application using Rust:
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world");
}
``` 
This is quite straightforward and simple for the beginning of learning rust or any other programming language. It prints out 'Hello, world' to console whenever it runs on your system (assuming you run this program from a file with that name). The function `main` in Rust serves as an entry point into our application which takes no parameters even if there are none passed when calling the main method of rust programs.
