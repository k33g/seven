Sure, here's an example of how you can write the simplest possible Hello World (also known as "hello world" in other contexts) program in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!"); // Prints "Hello, World" to the console. The string in parentheses is called an argument and it's a text we want our program print out with hello world before it
}
``` 
In this Rust code, `main` is the entry point of an application. Every program in rust must have a main function that's annotated with "fn" and returns `void` or at least the appropriate types for each argument. Here we return nothing (which is equivalent to returning an empty tuple in Python) and print out "Hello, World!"
