title: Little Teacher

best-params: |
  with: deepseek-coder
  temperature: 0.5
  predictRepeatLastN: 2

  If I augment the temperature (0.8), the LLM will give more instruction.
  Same remark with temperature (1.0).

  If I augment the predictRepeatLastN (>2), the formatting is less good.

  With the human message:
  The first sentence: "I need a clear explanation regarding the following question:"
  has a strong impact on the answer (the answer is better, more controlled and more natural).
