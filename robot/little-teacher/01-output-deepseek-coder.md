Sure, I can provide a basic example of a "Hello, World!" program in Golang. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Setup Go Environment**
   - Install Go from the official website: https://golang.org/doc/install
   - Set up your Go workspace. This is the directory where you'll work on your Go projects.
   - Initialize your workspace by running `go mod init example.com` in your terminal. Replace `example.com` with your own domain.
   - Create a new file in your workspace with the name `main.go`.
   - Open the file and write the following code:
     ```go
     package main
     import "fmt"
     func main() {
         fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
     }
     ```
   - Save the file and run your program by running `go run main.go` in your terminal.
   - If everything is set up correctly, you should see the output "Hello, World!" in your terminal.
   
2. **Explanation**
   - `package main`: This is the main package for the program. All Go programs must have a main package.
   - `import "fmt"`: This is the import statement. It imports the fmt package, which contains functions for formatted I/O with functions analogous to `printf` and `scanf`.
   - `func main()`: This is the main function. The `main` function is the entry point of any Go program.
   - `fmt.Println("Hello, World!")`: This is a function call. It prints the string "Hello, World!" to the standard output (usually your terminal).
   - `go run main.go`: This is the command to run the program. It compiles and runs the program.
   - If everything is set up correctly, you should see the output "Hello, World!" in your terminal.
